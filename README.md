# Spirit Animals

Spirit Animals is a front-end project built with HTML and Bootstrap 5, with some custom SASS to change the appearance of default Bootstrap styles. It emulates a typical tech or SaaS website.

A live version of this project is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://dylanhamada.github.io/spiritanimals/).

I tried to incorporate the following concepts and techniques I'd just learned into this project:

- Bootstrap
- SASS
    - Variables
    - Maps
    - Nesting
- JavaScript DOM manipulation
